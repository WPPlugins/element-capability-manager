This plugin prevents you from modifing any element of a specific post type, leaving all the others editable.


== Description ==

Element Capability Manager creates a system to allow editors (or any other role) to modify pages / post types but it blocks specific individual pages / post types chosen by the admin.
For example if you want to allow your editors to modify your pages but you want to lock your homepage, this is the right plugin for you!

The plugin is only available in English and Italian (send me others translations at ecm@synapse-lab.it).
Custom post types and custom user roles are supported.
Compatible with Members plugin.
